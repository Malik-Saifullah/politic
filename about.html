            <h3>Muhammad Ali Jinnah</h3>
            <blockquote> &quot; With faith, discipline and selfless devotion to duty, there is nothing worthwhile that
                you cannot achieve &quot; </blockquote>
            <p id="by" class="text-right">- Muhammad Ali Jinnah</p>
            <p><strong>Muhammad Ali Jinnah</strong> (born 25 December 1876 – 11 September 1948) was a <em>lawyer</em>,
                <em>politician</em> and the founder of Pakistan. Jinnah served as the leader of the <strong>All-India
                    Muslim League</strong> from 1913 until Pakistan's creation on 14 August 1947, and then as Pakistan's
                first <strong>Governor-General</strong> until his death. He is revered in Pakistan as
                <em>Quaid-i-Azam</em> ("Great Leader") and <em>Baba-i-Qaum</em>, <em>"Father of the Nation"</em>. His
                birthday is considered a <em>national holiday</em> in Pakistan.</p>
            <p class="last-p">Born at <em>Wazir Mansion</em> in <em>Karachi</em>, Jinnah was trained as a
                <em>barrister</em> at
                <em>Lincoln's Inn</em> in <em>London</em>. Upon his
                return to <em>British India</em>, he enrolled at the <em>Bombay High Court</em>, and took an interest in
                national
                politics, which eventually replaced his legal practice. Jinnah rose to prominence in the <em>Indian
                    National
                    Congress</em> in the first two decades of the 20th century. In these early years of his political
                career,
                Jinnah advocated <em>Hindu–Muslim unity</em>, helping to shape the 1916 <em>Lucknow Pact</em> between
                the Congress and the
                All-India Muslim League, in which Jinnah had also become prominent. Jinnah became a key leader in the
                <em>All India Home Rule League</em>, and proposed a <em>fourteen-point constitutional reform plan</em>
                to safeguard the
                political rights of Muslims. In 1920, however, Jinnah resigned from the Congress when it agreed to
                follow a campaign of <em>satyagraha</em>, which he regarded as <em>political anarchy</em>.</p>

        <div class="container">
            <p id="first-p">By 1940, Jinnah had come to believe that Muslims of the <em>Indian subcontinent</em> should
                have
                their own state. In that year, the Muslim League, led by Jinnah, passed the <em>Lahore Resolution</em>,
                demanding
                a separate nation. During the <em>Second World War</em>, the League gained strength while leaders of the
                Congress
                were imprisoned, and in the <em>elections</em> held shortly after the war, it won most of the seats
                reserved for
                Muslims. Ultimately, the Congress and the Muslim League could not reach a power-sharing formula for the
                subcontinent to be united as a single state, leading all parties to agree to the independence of a
                predominantly Hindu India, and for a Muslim-majority state of Pakistan.</p>
            <p class="last-p">As the first Governor-General of Pakistan, Jinnah worked to establish the new nation's
                government and policies, and to aid the millions of <em>Muslim migrants</em> who had emigrated from the
                new
                nation of <em>India</em> to Pakistan after <em>independence</em>, personally supervising the
                establishment of refugee
                camps. Jinnah died at age 71 in September 1948, just over a year after Pakistan gained independence from
                the <em>United Kingdom</em>. He left a deep and respected legacy in Pakistan. Innumerable streets, roads
                and
                localities in the world are named after Jinnah. Several <em>universities and public buildings</em> in
                Pakistan
                bear Jinnah's name. According to his biographer, <em>Stanley Wolpert</em>, he remains Pakistan's
                greatest leader.
